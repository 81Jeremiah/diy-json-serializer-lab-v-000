# Diy Json Serializer Lab

## Objectives

  1. Write a JSON Serializer
  2. Use that JSON to render information

## Outline

  * Take the solution from previous lab (The products one)
  * Goal here is to replace the show page of products, and then to include a new link called "next product" that loads the data for the next product without page refresh
  * Have them create a new route called like `/products/:id/data`. Write their own serializer class
